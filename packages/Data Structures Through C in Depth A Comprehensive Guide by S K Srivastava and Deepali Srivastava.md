In this section, we will briefly introduce some of the data structures that are covered in the book and their applications.
 
## Arrays
 
An array is a collection of homogeneous elements that are stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element of an array can be accessed by its index, which is a positive integer that represents its position in the array. Arrays are useful for storing and manipulating data that have a fixed size and order, such as matrices, vectors, and strings.
 
## Strings
 
A string is a special type of array that stores a sequence of characters. Strings are used to represent text data, such as names, messages, and commands. Strings can be manipulated using various operations, such as concatenation, comparison, searching, and reversing.
 
## Linked Lists
 
A linked list is a collection of heterogeneous elements that are stored in non-contiguous memory locations. Each element of a linked list is called a node, which contains some data and a pointer to the next node. The first node of a linked list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. Linked lists are useful for storing and manipulating data that have a variable size and order, such as polynomials, queues, and stacks.
 
## Stacks
 
A stack is a special type of linked list that follows the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. That means that the last element that is inserted into the stack is the first one that is removed from it. Stacks are used to implement various algorithms, such as recursion, expression evaluation, and backtracking.
 
## Queues
 
A queue is a special type of linked list that follows the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle. That means that the first element that is inserted into the queue is the first one that is removed from it. Queues are used to implement various algorithms, such as breadth-first search, simulation, and scheduling.
